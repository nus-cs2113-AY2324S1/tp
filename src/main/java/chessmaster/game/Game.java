     * Manages the main gameplay of ChessMaster

     * It starts by displaying the initial game setup, including the chessboard, and then enters a loop where players
     * take turns making moves.
     * If a player enters a valid move, the chessboard is updated, and the game progresses.
     * If an exception is encountered during this process, an error message is displayed to the user.
     * The loop continues until the game ends or specific commands are issued to abort, restart, or exit the game.
     *
     * @return true if the game has ended, either by checkmate, stalemate,
     *     or if users wants to reset the game. Returns false if the game is aborted.
