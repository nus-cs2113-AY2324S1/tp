## Overview

CashLeh? is a CLI application mainly supporting working adults and students who struggle with managing finances.
It allows them to set a budget and track both their earnings and spending habits in a seamless way to have a
neat overview of their financial situation.

The program is written in Java and has about 5 kLoC. Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

* **Code Contributed:** [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=danielpappa&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)
* **Features**:
    * Implemented the basic structure for incomes and the related commands (add, delete and view).
    * Implemented the basic structure for the income statement and the overall financial statement which comprises both income and expense statement entries.
    * Added the ability to set, update and delete a budget:
      * What it does: allows the user to handle his overall cash-flow by specifying a budget. The budget in CashLeh is kept separate from net cash on hand, meaning that is is to be interpreted as some sort of cushion which the user wants to always have at his availability.
      * Highlights: this implementation comes with an option for the user to view his current budget-level. By calling the appropriate command, both budget and net cash on hand, as well as a progress bar will be displayed.
* **Project Management:**
  * Managed releases v1.0 and v2.0 on GitHub
  * Helped maintaining the issue tracker on GitHub
* **Documentation**:
