# EssenMakanan
EssenMakanan is a **desktop app for managing recipes and ingredients in your inventory, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EssenMakanan can get your recipes and ingredients management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
