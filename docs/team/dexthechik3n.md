### Enhancements implemented
#### Feature
* **Add Dish** <br>
    Function: To allow the user to add a dish with the price and its ingredients to the menu<br>
  * The most crucial feature in the application in order for all the other features to perform their functions, which had to handle many arguments such as the names, price and quantity.
* **Exit** <br>
    Function: To exit from the application
  * Implemented the backend logic in the main class in order to detect the user entered the `bye` keyword in order to exit from the application which was important to allow the storage to text file functionality to work

### Enhancement
* Created the methods for reading and writing files in FileManager.java
* Created the regex patterns for most of the command features <br>
  * Required effort in learning how to format the regex string in order to get the specific intended user inputs 
* Created a ParserException class to allow for the use of handling specific errors<br>
e.g checking for repeated dish/ingredient name, invalid price type, missing arguments, etc.
