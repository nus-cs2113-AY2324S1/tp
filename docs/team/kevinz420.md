FITNUS is a fitness tracking app that allows NUS students to set and maintain fitness goals for themselves.
We support features that allowe students to track their eating, exercise, and fitness achievements
as they progress throughout their own personalized fitness journey.

## Contributions

### New Feature: Initial Project Setup
I was responsible for setting up the file structure of the project, and creating components that would be utilized
across all features. This included classes such as `Parser` to read in user inputs and `TextUi` to display data in a human-readable way as well as the main function that serves
as the entrypoint to our application. I also wrote custom Exceptions that will be used throughout our program to provide
more descriptive feedback when errors occur and are caught.

### New Feature: Command Class + Essential Commands
The `Command` class serves as the parent class for all commands supported by our program. As part of the initial setup, I also
implemented some general purpose commands such as `ExitCommand` and `HelpCommand` so that the rest of the team can successfully run
a barebone implementation of our application.

## Documentation
* User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features help and exit
* Developer Guide:
  * Added implementation details about handling user input and displaying output. 
## Team-Based Tasks:
  * Making bug fixes from bugs found by other students from the PE-D
  * Communicating with other members of the team to clarify how my features can be integrated with theirs
  * Helping other members of the team with the debugging process and suggesting methods to fix the problems they encounter
