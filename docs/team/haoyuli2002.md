# EssenMakanan
EssenMakanan is an application based on Command Line Interface(CLI) 
that provides an easy and intuitive way to keep track of ingredients you have in your kitchen. 
This helps avoid buying duplicated ingredients, 
reminds you of the ingredients you need, 
and gives a visualisation of the recipe timeline to ensure 
that advance preparation is done in time. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Contributions
New Feature:
- Create the class Step and Tag for Recipe
    - Create the Step class so that the user can specify each step when using a recipe
    - Create the enumeration class Tag so that user can sort their step according to the Tag

New Feature:

  - Check if there are at least one step under this tag, 
  if yes, then print them out, if not, then skip this tag
