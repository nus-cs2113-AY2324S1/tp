FITNUS is a desktop fitness tracking application that allows NUS students to set and maintain fitness goals for themselves. The user interacts with it using a command line interface(CMI). It is believed that if user can type fast, the efficiency of using this app will be much higher than an usual application that supports graphic interface.

## Contributions

### The Calorie Goal Class
The way that I contributed to the project is by creating and implementing the Goal class and its associated classes including the various goal command classes, goal and goalList data type classes, and goal storage class. The app now allows user to input a new calories consumption target on a particular date. It is able to spot errors if the user input a wrong date that is passed or not in the designated format. It also allows user to make achievement from goals, with supported view function and delete function.

### Documentation
I contributed to the UG in the parts that are related to goal related classes. In the DG, I contributed to the `Adding a new exercise goal` section.

### Team-Based Tasks
* Release various issues about improvement and bug reports of the app
* Enable assertions in gradle
* Correct coding style problems for all classes before v2.1 
* Update UG for calorie goal related functionality
* Add table of content with markdowns for all parts in UG
* Add questions and answers for FAQs part in UG
* Add features and future developments in UG to enhance completeness
* Add more detailed method documentations to improve readibility
* Change the overall user input processing to allow more flexible inputs for all functionalities
* Review code contributed by teammates and give advice on what can improve
