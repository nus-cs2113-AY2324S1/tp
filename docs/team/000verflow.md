#### Enhancements implemented

**Enhancements**:
1. Classes and methods to format display and messages to users.
2. Find command to search and return resources that match all given arguments.
3. Storage class that can save and load resources and events.
4. GenericList class to act as a container for both Resource lists and Event lists.


**Details:**

**1. Classes and methods to format display and messages to users**

Main classes and methods implemented:
`Syslib` class
`UI` class

Created the Syslib and UI class's to ensure proper OOP used for running the software, taking inputs from users, and displaying output through the UI class.

**2. Find feature for resources**

Main implementation: `FindCommand` class

Implemented the **Find** feature that will return resources that match given filters such as `author`, `title`, `id` and `isbn`.
Only returns results that match `ALL` the given filters not `ANY`.

**3. Storage Class**

Main implementation: `Storage` class

Implemented the Storage class which allows users to `save` resources and events that have been added to the list. The resources and events will be loaded back into the appropriate lists, when the program is run again.
The storage class is filled with exception catching mechanisms to ensure minimal bugs in case of corrupted data.

**4. GenericList Class**

Main Implementation: `GenericList` class

Implemented the GenericList class which allows us to store 2 lists of Resources and Events separately. This allows us to handle loading, storing and command handling efficiently. 
GenericList currently is just used as a container for both types of lists.
