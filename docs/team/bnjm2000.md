## Overview

SysLib is a command-line interface (CLI) software designed for system librarians, particularly those with proficient typing skills.
It offers a comprehensive set of functions, including viewing, adding, searching, editing, deleting, and saving, to effectively oversee library resources and events.

#### Enhancements implemented

**Enhancements**:
1. Methods to display messages to users and keep outputs consistent
2. Summary Feature for Resources
3. Edit feature for Events
4. Status of attribute for resources


**Details:**

**1. Methods to display messages to users**

Main methods implemented:

`showHelpMessage()` and `showExitMessage()`

Also ensured that all outputs are consistent with a divider line so as to easily
differentiate between a user input or program output (much harder than it sounds.)

**2. Summary feature**

Main implementation: `SummaryCommand` class

Implemented the **summary** feature.

Summarises all resources that are currently in the database by item type and helpfully displays it into a bar based on quantity for easy viewing.

Also summarises all events, shows the total number of events and shows the 3 upcoming events in order.

**3. Edit feature for Events**

Main implementation:

`EventEditCommand` class

Implemented the `eventedit` feature for all events.

Edit feature supports editing:
- **For all events:**
- Able to edit any attribute of any `Event` except the assigned ID:
  - Title
  - Date
  - Description

Implemented validation and error checking for EventEditCommand, which prevents changing of any attribute of no new changes were input.
In that scenario, prints a message to the user to say that no attributes were changed

Ensures that if the Date attribute of the `Event` was to be changed, the edited `Event` would be slot in in accordance to the date.

**4. Status attribute for Resources**

Main implementation: `getStatus()`, `setStatus()` in `Resource` class

Implemented methods in Resource class which sets the status of the resource when executing `addCommand` (defaults to AVAILABLE when no input is given).
This attribute indicates the status of the resource. To do so, an enumerator was created with `AVAILABLE`, `BORROWED` OR `LOST` was created.

Also allowed resource's status to be able to be edited later.

**4. Help Command**

Main implementation: `HelpCommand` class

Allows users to key in `help` so give the users a basic understanding of the commands available as well as to lead
the users to the User Guide for more information if they would like.

Allowed for the commands to be easily be understood as well as a short explanation of the commands and easy-to-read examples.

**5. Exit Command**

Main implementation: `ExitCommand` class

Implemented the **exit** feature to allow the user to exit the program safely.
Prints a message to the user to indicate that their stored information has been saved and they are exiting the program.

```
Thanks for using SysLib! We have saved the current resources and events.
See you next time!

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Helped managed some issues and milestones by using keywords and closing when completed.
- Bug test 2.0 .jar file and created issues based on bugs found.
- Help troubleshoot when checks fail on GitHub.
- Conscientiously checked on the code to ensure consistency in coding standards and outputs.
- Updates UG and DG of the changes when a change is made to the output.
- Ensures that all outputs returns with a line separator to ensure easy distinguishability between user input and program output
- Ensured `help` command, DG and UG are up-to-date with sample input and outputs whenever changed.
- Tested Syslib to ensure everything works the same on macOS.

#### Review/mentoring contributions:

- Reviewed multiple peer pull requests.
- Gave constructive and witty comments to improve teammates' morale.
- Assisted in debugging own group's code.

#### Contributions beyond the project team:

- Helped test other group's project during PE-D, creating 8 bug issues
- Peer reviewed other team's developers guide in their [PR](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2324S1/tp/pull/11/files#diff-1a95edf069a4136e9cb71bee758b0dc86996f6051f0d438ec2c424557de7160b)
