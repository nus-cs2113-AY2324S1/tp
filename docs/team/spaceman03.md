## Project: NUScents

Welcome to ðŸª™NUScentsðŸª™, the tailor-made financial tracker for SOC students at NUS. It is optimized for use via a 
Command Line Interface (CLI) to offer a clutter-free solution for our users to manage and monitor their financial 
activities. It is written in Java and has about 3kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: *Add list transactions command*
    * What it does: *Lists all the transactions in NUScents.*
    * Justification: *The `list` command was refactored from Spaceman Task Manager's implementation to make modifications on `Transaction` objects and its fields*
    * Credits: *Spaceman Task Manager, which NUScents' `list` feature was refactored from*


* **New Feature**: *Add feature to categorise expenses*
    * What it does: *Categorise expenses in NUScents.*
    * Justification: *Possible categories include `FOOD`, `ENTERTAINMENT`, `TRANSPORTATION`, `UTILITY`, `RENT`, 
  `OTHER_EXPENSE`.*


* **Bug fix**: *Ensure program detects invalid date*
  * Ensure a correct error message is displayed when an invalid date is provided by the user.
