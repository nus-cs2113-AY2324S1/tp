# Project Portfolio: Chess Master

By: Tong Zheng Hong

## Overview
As a key contributor to the Chess Master project, I played a central role in developing the foundational classes for the game, including the `Game` and `ChessMaster` classes. These classes serve as the backbone of the chess-playing application, managing overall game processing and execution. My responsibilities extended to crafting a comprehensive user guide and developer guide to ensure a seamless experience for both end-users and fellow developers.

## Chess Master Class
The ChessMaster class acts as the orchestrator, handling the primary game loop, player turns, move execution, and game state management. I meticulously designed and implemented this class to provide a robust and enjoyable chess-playing experience. The ChessMaster class integrates seamlessly with other components, such as the chessboard, players, and user interface.
`Game` Class

The `Game` class encapsulates the core logic for the chess game. It manages players, moves, and the chessboard. My role involved defining and implementing essential game functionalities within this class, ensuring smooth gameplay and adherence to chess rules. The `Game` class also interacts with the ChessMaster class to maintain the flow of the overall game.

## Overall Game Processing and Execution
Contributing to the overall game processing and execution, I focused on creating a stable and engaging environment for users. This encompassed implementing turn-based moves, handling player input, and ensuring proper execution of game commands. My efforts aimed to deliver an immersive and error-free gaming experience.

## User Guide and Developer Guide
I worked on the the introductory part, including the overvie, quick start and the gameplay specifications. This entailed providing players with clear instructions on gameplay, commands, and features, with a specific section dedicated to the turn-based nature of the game. Simultaneously, the developer guide offers valuable insights into the project's structure, class interactions, and guidelines for future enhancements, especially in the context of the turn-based gameplay mechanics.
