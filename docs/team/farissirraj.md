### Summary of Contributions

#### Key Contributions


* **Steps Class**
    - Wrote the class for `Step` which was used to store the steps taken by the user as an object.
    - Wrote the methods to enable parsing, formatting and other operations required within the object.
    - Added on to the Parser and Storage classes to integrate this feature with the existing functionality of the codebase.


* **Add and Delete steps**  
    - What it does: allows user to add in their steps and view their steps for the day.
    - Calculate the number of steps taken in a particular day.
    - Delete steps that were added by mistake.
    - Justification: this feature helps user to track their steps and compare it with their daily goals.


* **List Steps**  
    - What it does: allows user to view the steps in a list. 
    - Delete steps that were added by mistake.
    - Justification: Enables the user to better decide on what operation they want to do. For example, deleting a step uses the index in the list as a reference and viewing the list of steps will allow them to carefully select which entry to delete.


* **Calculate the calories consumed** 
    - What it does: Calculate the calories consumed based on the meals eaten.
    - Justification: Allows the user to keep track of their fitness goals through the calories consumed from meals.


* **Calculate the total number of steps walked**
  - What it does: Calculate the total number of steps walked in a given day.
  - Justification: Allows the user to keep track of their daily step count. This will allow the user to analyse their walking habits just as they do for their meals and workouts.


* **Provide suggestions on how many more steps need to be walked to reach the daily calorie goal.** 
    - What it does: Calculate the calories consumed based on the number of steps walked.
    - Justification: Allows the user to keep track of their calorie expenses through walking alone.


* **Provide a suggestion on the ideal weight range for the user.** 
  - What it does: Calculates the ideal weight range for the user provided their height as entered in the user profile.
  - Justification: Allows the user to be mindful of their weight as they are on the journey to becoming fit.
  

* **JUnit Tests:** JUnit Testing of Code Written.
    - Made an active effort to write as many JUnit tests for the code I wrote as possible.
    - Made sure this was seamlessly integrated with the existing CI pipeline that we were working along.
