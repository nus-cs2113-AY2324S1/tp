## Project: FinText

FinText is a Command Line Interface (CLI)-based personal finance tracker to make it easy for users to track \
and manage their spending, and generate daily/weekly/monthly reports to break down how they spend.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- New Feature: Added a edit function to allow users to handle edit commands from the user.
  - What it does: Allows the user to be able to edit income/expense transactions and their fields, excluding the date field.
  - Justification: This allows the user to update transactions or fix mistakes/typos in previous commands in an easy fashion.

- Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=itayrefaely&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

- Contributions to team-based tasks:  played a major role in shaping the project idea, defining its goals, \
  identifying the problem to solve, and outlining the initial structure.
