### Project: QuizHub
QuizHUB is a local desktop app designed to help NUS students easily record examinable questions and generate quizzes
from their very own question bank to test their understanding via a Command Line Interface (CLI). Easily launch-able
on the go, QuizHUB is a versatile tool that aims to streamline and optimize the revision experience for NUS students
from all fields of study.

### Summary of Contributions
- **Code Contributions:** [Link to reposense contribution](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=spinoandraptos&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false).
- The project structure of QuizHub is adapted from Juncheng's [ip](https://github.com/spinoandraptos/ip). Juncheng is
  responsible for migrating the skeleton code structure into the team repository and aligning the team for the initial
  integration cycle. [#6](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/6)

### New Feature 1: `Edit Question`
[#10](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/10),
[#20](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/20)
- **What:** Enables users to edit an existing question's question or answer for short answer questions
- **Justification:** Users may have accidentally typed the question or answer incorrectly, or question answer needs
  to be updated following a change in syllabus

### Enhancement 1: `Reinforcement of Edit Question Command`
[#113](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/113),
[#125](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/125)
- **What:** Performs checks to ensure an `edit` command does not have excessive arguments and payloads, and handles
  much more comprehensive types of edge cases for user input
- **Justification:** Ensures the program does not crash due to erroneous user commands to facilitate a 
  smoother experience for users under the stress of exam revisions

### New Feature 2: `Question Difficulty`
[#57](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/57),
[#45](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/45)
- **What:** Enables users to assign or change the difficulty level to a question
- **Justification:** Allows users to identify questions which may require more practise to assist them in their revision

### Enhancement 2: `Reinforcement of Mark Difficulty Command`
[#114](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/114),
[#125](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/125)
- **What:** Performs checks to ensure a `markdiff` command does not have excessive arguments and payloads, and handles
much more comprehensive types of edge cases for user input
- **Justification:** Ensures the program does not crash due to erroneous user commands to facilitate a
smoother experience for users under the stress of exam revisions

### New Feature 3: `Sort Question List by Module`
[#59](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/59)
- **What:** Enables users to find all questions belonging to specified modules and build a question list comprising
  solely of these questions
- **Justification:** Provides users with the flexibility to attempt questions targeted towards only modules they wish
  to further revise on, facilitating higher studying efficiency

### Enhancement 3: `Parser Methods Abstraction`
[#128](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/128),
[#122](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/122),
[#105](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/105)
- **What:** Broke down methods for parsing long and complicated user commands like `start` and `edit` into multiple
    short and abstracted methods which manage the parsing and exception handling of different segments of the user input
- **Justification:** Parsing long and complicated user commands in a single method results in excessively long methods
  which not only violates OOP principles but also makes debugging challenging

### Code Testing and Improvement:
[#125](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/125),
[#101](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/101),
[#62](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/62),

[#24](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/24),
[#92](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/issues/92)
* Performed JUnit testing for commands to identify error-prone user input combinations
- Ensured JUnit tests cover user input formats that are prone to bugs for the following commands:
  * CommandEdit
  * CommandList
  * CommandMarkDifficulty
  * CommandStart

### Team-Based Task Contributions:
- Helped to standardise the style of all UML diagrams through the creation of a `Styles.puml` template file which is applied
  to all UML diagrams created using PlantUML extension
- Refactored code for general code enhancements
  * Performed code abstraction in `parser` class to avoid deep nesting and excessively long methods
  * Broke down methods which parse long and complicated user commands, such as `edit` and `start` into distinct 
  shorter methods that handles different segments of the user input and different exceptions
  * Performed code abstraction for methods that involve string literals and printing ui feedback to avoid 
  hard-coding and repeating string literals which is prone to errors
  * Refactored code to meet checkstyle requirements
- Assisted in issue tracker maintenance to ensure team members are assigned to the right issues and avoid 
potential work conflict
