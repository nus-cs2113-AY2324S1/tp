FITNUS is a fitness tracking app that allows NUS students to set and maintain fitness goals for themselves.

## Contributions

### The ExerciseLog Class
The way that I contributed to the project is by creating and implementing the ExerciseLog class and its associated classes. For example,
there are specific commands that users who want to interact with the exercise log can use, which are the log, delete, update, and view commands.
This gives the user full CRUD functionality of the exercise log.

### Documentation
I contributed to the UG in the parts that are related to the ExerciseLog class and the introduction. In the DG, I contributed to the `Update Exercises from Log feature` section and all the diagrams in that section.

### Team-Based Tasks
* Set up milestone v1.0
* Upload v1.0 and v2.0 jar files to Github
* Enable assertions in gradle
* Update UG for ExerciseLog-related functionality
* Fix errors whenever CI/CD checks were not passed
* Correct grammar errors in documentation
