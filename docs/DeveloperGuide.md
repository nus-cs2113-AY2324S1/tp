# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

We first give acknowledgement to Module Coordinator, Dr Akshay Narayan, and Teaching Assistant, Irving for guidance and supervision over the KaChinnnng project.

We utilised the following resources to aid us in the development of KaChinnnng:
-  [tp project](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2324S1/tp) of the nus-cs2113-AY2324S1 organisation
-  [addressbook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2) & [addressbook-level3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) project by SE-EDU largely inspired the format and coding style of KaChinnnng.


## Design & implementation

Below are the design and implementation details of KaChinnnng.

### Design

The architectural diagram of KaChinnnng is as follows:

![ArchitectureDiagram.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/ArchitectureDiagram.png?raw=true)

The KaChinnnng program will first enter the `run` state where the `storage` class will be accessed and data will be retrieved if the application has been used before. If the application has not been used before, the `storage` class will create a new file to store the data.

Next, the `User` will input various `commands` via the `Ui` class. The `commands` will then be parsed by the `Parser` class and the relevant `managers` will be called to execute the `commands`.

Once the `User` inputs has been successfully executed, `commands` will make use of the `Ui` class to output the relevant information to the user.

When the `User` exits the program, the `storage` class will be called to save the data to the local storage.

`Storage` will read from the local storage when the program is run again.

### Expense Class Overview

The Expenses are divided into three categories. Transport, Utilities and Food.
Each of the categories inherits from a base Expense class which in turn
inherits from the FinancialRecord class.

![expense_class_diagram.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/expense_class_diagram.png?raw=true)
### IncomeManager

the IncomeManager is facilitated by `IncomeParser`, `IncomeManager`, `IncomeList` and `Ui`.

1. The user inputs the command to add income. This input is then passed to `IncomeParser` to be parsed.
2. `IncomeParser` then parses the input and returns a `Income` object.
3. `IncomeManager` then adds the `Income` object to the `IncomeList`.
4. `IncomeManager` then returns a `String` to `Ui` to be printed out to the user.

![IncomeManager_seqdiagram.drawio.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/IncomeManager_SequenceDiagram(updated).png?raw=true)

### ExpenseManager

The ExpenseManager is facilitated by `ExpenseParser`,  `ExpenseManager`, `ExpenseList` and `Ui`

1. The user inputs the command to add expense.
2. This command is used to instantiate a ExpenseManager object which is executed.
3. During execution, the command is passed to ExpenseParser which extracts and parses the input fields.
4. Input field information is passed to the relevant Expense constructor which returns an Expense object.
5. Expense object is returned to ExpenseManager from ExpenseParser.
6. Expense object is returned to Duke from ExpenseManager.

![expenseManager_sequence_diagram.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/expenseManager_sequence_diagram.png?raw=true)

### Find Command
The FindCommand is facilitated by `FindCommand`, `FindParser`, `Ui`,`ExpenseList` and `IncomeList`.

1. The user will first input the command to find the expense or income.
```
find /t <type> /cat [category] /de [description] /date [date]
```
2. The inputs will then be passed to `FindParser` to get the necessary fields such as type, category, description and date.
3. The FindCommand is then instantiated with the necessary fields.
4. Users can choose to search through the expense list or income list.
5. If users searches through the income list, either the `/de description` or `/date date` will be used to search through the income list, category will be ignored.
6. If users searches through the expense list, either the `/cat category`, `/de description` or `/date date` will be used to search through the expense list.
7. The execute method will then be called to search through the list and return the list of expenses or incomes that matches the search criteria.

![FindCommand_SequenceDiagram.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/FindCommand_SequenceDiagram(updated).drawio.png?raw=true)

### GetFromTxt Command
The GetFromTxt Command is facilitated by `IOException`,`Scanner`, `KaChinnnngException`, `IncomeList` and `ExpenseList`
1. The user start the program and the command will start automatically with a default path
2. Once the command executed, it will try to create a txt file on the default path
3. If file failed to create, throw an `IOException`
4. Catch the `IOException` and print error messages
5. Create a `Scanner` Object s to get content from txt file
6. If amount in txt file exceed limit or incorrect, throw `KaChinnnnngException`
7. Read the content on the file and add corresponding object to incomes or expenses list

![GetFromTxtCommands_SequenceDiagram.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/GetFromTxt.png?raw=true)

### ExchangeRateManager
The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario 
where the user issues the command `update exchange rate USD 0.8`.
1. The user input the command `update exchange rate USD 0.8`
2. Duke will create the `UpdateExchangeRateCommand` object with the specified currency and rate
3. Duke will the execute the command object which will call `updateExchangeRate` in ExchangeRateManager
4. If the currency specified is not a supported currency or the rate specified is not a decimal with 0.001 and 3,000,000,
   a `KaChinnnningException` will be thrown
5. Once the update is successful, Ui will be called to show the completion message
6. Lastly, the updated exchange rates will be saved in the exchange rate file

![UpdateExchangeRate_SequenceDiagram.png](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-3/tp/blob/master/images/UpdateExchangeRate_SequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)

This is facilitated by `Duke`, `Ui`, `UpdateExchangeRateCommand`, `ExchangeRateManager`'and `ExchangeRateFileHandler`.

### SaveToTxt Command
The SaveToTxt Command is facilitated by `FileWriter` ,`IncomeList` and `ExpenseList`
1. The user start the program and the function will run everytime after user input a command
2. Once the command executed, the function saveIncomeAndExpense will run automatically
3. It will run the function saveIncomeToTextFile first, the saveIncomeToTextFile will create a FileWriter and loop through the incomes list
4. It will get description, date, and amount from the income list for every single income record in the list and save the information into the text file
5. After that, the saveIncomeToTextFile will then call the saveExpenseToTextFile function 
6. The saveExpenseToTextFile will create a new FileWriter and loop through the expenses list 
7. It will get description, date, amount and type from the expenses list for every single expense record in the list and save the information into the text file

## Product scope
### Target user profile
Target user profile:
- has a need to manage one's finance and track their financial health
- prefer desktop apps over mobile app/web app
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI applications

### Value proposition: 
KaChinnnng is a financial planner for users to track and improve their financial health. It allows users who are more comfortable with Command Line Interface (CLI) applications to record and track their financials faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. Additionally, it provides a quick and easy currency conversion feature that allows users to convert their overseas expenses into SGD. By tracking one's financial health, one can make more informed financial decisions in the future.
