## Design & implementation

## Design

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of our EssenMakanan CLI.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

![ArchitectureDiagram.png](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

**Main components of the architecture**

- `UI`: The user interface of the app that handles all print and output commands
- `Main`: EssenMakanan main code which handles `Storage`, `Parser` and `Ui`
- `Storage`: Handles stored all `recipe`, `ingredient` and `shortcut` that the user has input
- `Parser`: Handles user input and checks for formatting/command errors and throws relevant exceptions
- `Command`: Command handles the user functionality of Essenmakanan
- `Shortcut`: Shortcuts to be used by user
- `Ingredient`: Ingredients in inventory and recipe ingredients
- `Recipe`: Recipes created by user
- `Logger`: A logger that logs the activities done in storage

<a id="recipe-component"></a>
### Recipe component

1. Upon booting up the application, `RecipeList` will retrieve past recipe data by calling `restoreSavedData` 
in the Storage class. The restored `recipes` will then be stored in `RecipeList`. If the `recipes.txt` file does 
not exist, no data is retrieved and RecipeList will be empty.
2. Each `RecipeList` consists of zero to as many Recipe in it's ArrayList. 
3. Each `Recipe` in RecipeList consists of exactly one `RecipeIngredientList`, up to four `Tag` and 
exactly one `RecipeStepList`.
4. `RecipeIngredientList` consists of at least one Ingredient while `RecipeStepList` consists of at least one step.


<img src="images/RecipeListClassDiagram.png" width="800"/>

Two main functionalities that we have are to `add` and `delete` a recipe from the recipeList. Below is an object diagram to illustrate how the add and delete function works.

1. The initial state of `recipes:RecipeList` stores 2 `Recipe`, namely, 'chicken pizza' and 'meatball noodles' <br>![RecipeListInitialState](images/RecipeListInitialState.png)
2. `Add` a new recipe <br> A new recipe titled "dumpings" will be added to `recipes:RecipeList`. The number of `recipe` stored in `recipes:RecipeList` will increase from 2 to 3. ![RecipeListAdd](images/RecipeListAdd.png)
3. `Delete` an existing recipe
   Recipe titled "chicken pizza" is at index 2 of the `RecipeList`. By giving the command `delete r/2`, `recipes:RecipeList` will remove `chicken pizza:Recipe` from the ArrayList of recipes. <br> ![RecipeListDelete](images/RecipeListDelete.png)

### Ingredient component

![IngredientListClassDiagram.png](images%2FIngredientListClassDiagram.png)

<a id="shortcut-component"></a>
### Shortcut component

1. Upon booting up the application, `ShortcutList` will retrieve past recipe data by calling `restoreSavedData` 
   in the Storage class. The restored `shortcuts` will then be stored in `ShortcutList`. If the `shortcuts.txt`
   file does not exist, no data is retrieved and RecipeList will be empty.
2. Each `ShortcutList` consists of zero to as many Shortcut in it's ArrayList.

![ShortcutListClassDiagram.png](images%2FShortcutListClassDiagram.png)

![ShortcutListObjectDiagram.png](images%2FShortcutListObjectDiagram.png)

<a id="storage-component"></a>
### Storage component

In this application, it uses text files to store all data, i.e, recipes, ingredients and shortcuts. The data will be
kept in `recipes.txt`, `ingredients.txt` and `shortcuts.txt` in the `data` folder.

When booting up the application, `restoreSavedData` will be called to get both recipes and ingredients 
from the previous session.

![img.png](images/RestoreIngredientStorageSequenceDiagram.png)
![img.png](images/RestoreRecipeStorageSequenceDiagram.png)
![img.png](images/RestoreShortcutStorageSequenceDiagram.png)

When a user exits the application, `saveData` will be called and it will convert all data from recipes and
ingredients into a string which will be put in their own respective text files.

![img.png](images/StoreRecipeStorageSequenceDiagram.png)
![img.png](images/StoreShortcutStorageSequenceDiagram.png)

<a id="logger-component"></a>
### Logger component

In this application, a customised logger is used by recipe, ingredient and shortcut storage. This logger will log
all activity done and errors in the storages. The logger will use `INFO`, `WARNING` or `SEVERE` levels for the logs.
The logs will be saved in `essenmakanan.log` inside the `data` folder.

  to standard output


### Check recipe feature

The check recipe feature is used by the `CheckRecipeCommand` class.

To view if you have all ingredients needed to start on a recipe, use the following command
`check recipe RECIPE_TITLE` or `check recipe RECIPE_ID`

By calling `executeCommand` on the class, the steps will
be executed as follows:
* **Step1**

  `CheckRecipeCommand` will get the index of recipe by calling method `getRecipeIndex()` in the `Parser` class. 
  This method will throw an error if the recipe entered is invalid or does not exist in the recipe database.


* **Step2**

  `CheckRecipeCommand` will then call its own `getMissingIngredients()` method which will create 3 different array lists - `missingIngredeints`, `insufficientIngredients` and `diffUnitIngredients`. 
  They account for ingredients that are missing, ingredients that you currently don't have enough of in your inventory, and ingredients that cannot be compared because of the difference in unit respectively.


* **Step3**

  `CheckRecipeCommand` then call the static method `printRecipeMessage()` in `UI` class to print missing ingredients, ingredients that are insufficient, and ingredients of different units. 


* **Step4**

  `Ui` will call `listIngredients()` method in `IngredientList` class to print the 3 different array lists.

![img_1.png](images/CheckRecipeSequenceDiagram.png)

### Filter recipe feature

The filter recipe feature is used by the `FilterRecipesCommand`.

To filter recipes based on ingredients that are in it,
use the command `filter recipe i/INGREDIENT_NAME [i/...]`, where `INGREDIENT_ID` can be used in place of `INGREDIENT_NAME` too.

* **Step1**

  `FilterRecipeCommand` will start a loop that filters all ingredients that the user has input


* **Step2**

  In the loop, the recipes will be filtered and be stored in `filteredRecipes` variable which is a `RecipeList` object.
  `filteredRecipes` will contain all recipes that has the specified ingredient.


* **Step3**
  
  The filteredRecipes will then be passed to the static `Ui` method `printFilteredRecipes()` to display all the recipes with the specified ingredient.


* **Step4**

  Steps 2 to 3 will repeat again until all ingredients in the input has been handled and executed. The loop will then stop and process exits the loop.

the shortcut is used.

By calling `executeCommand` on the class, the steps will
be executed as follows:
* **Step1**

  `AddShortcutCommand` will parse a shortcut from a string. The parser will refer to the ingredient list for checking
  matching ingredient name and checks if the quantity is valid.

* **Step2**

  `AddShortcutCommand` will get a new `Shortcut` if all specifications are met, i.e. valid ingredient name and quantity.

* **Step3**

  `AddShortcutCommand` will add the newly created `Shortcut` into `ShortcutList`. Then, the ingredient will be 
  added into an`ArrayList` inside `ShortcutList`.

![img.png](images/AddNewShortcutSequenceDiagram.png)


### Edit Shortcut Feature

The edit shortcut feature is used by the `EditShortcutCommand`. Users can input `edit sc/INGREDIENT_NAME or 
SHORTCUT_INDEX n/INGREDIENT_NAME q/QUANTITY` to edit a shortcut with new ingredient name or new quantity. However, the 
changes for each attribute can only be done once per input line.

By calling `executeCommand` on the class, the steps will
be executed as follows:
* **Step1**

  `EditShortcutCommand` will parse an index of the shortcut that the input refers to. Then, `EditShortcutCommand` will
  get the shortcut from the list based on the index.

* **Step2**

  If the shortcut is found, `EditShortcutCommand` will parse the changes indicated by flags. It will go through all the
  flags and make changes based on the flags and whether the changes are valid, i.e. valid name or valid quantity.

* **Step3**

  After the changes has been made, `EditShortcutCommand` will call `Ui` class to 
  print out the changes made on the shortcut.
