## Design & implementation

___

### Main structure

### Architecture
![](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml)
The ***Architecture Diagram*** shows the high-level overview and design of the FitTrack app. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**Tip:** The '.puml' files used to create the diagrams in this document can be found in [diagrams](./diagrams) 
folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) 
to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The **`Main`** class is called [`FitTrack`](../src/main/java/fittrack/FitTrack.java).


### Core Sequence
Core sequence of code is written in [`FitTrack`](../src/main/java/fittrack/FitTrack.java) class.

![Outer structure](images/FitTrackOuter.svg "Outer Structure")

![Core structure](images/FitTrackCore.svg "Core Structure")

The App consists of five components.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* **`UI`**: The UI of the App.
* [**`Parser`**](#parser-component): Handles user input.
* **`Model`**: Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Command`**](#command-component): The command executor.

### Storage Component
API: `Storage.java`

Storage load and save functions are written in [`Storage`](../src/main/java/fittrack/storage/Storage.java) class.

![Structure of Storage Load](images/StorageLoad.svg)
The sequence diagram of the code for loading the file contents into each class.

![Structure of Storage Save](images/StorageSave.svg)
The sequence diagram of the code for saving meal list data into mealList.txt file

The `Storage` component,
* can save user profile data in text format and load it back
* can save meals in text format and load it back
* can save workouts in text format and load it back

**Design Considerations**
* There are two methods to implement saving of data. Either save data after every command or save everything upon exiting the program.
* Option 1 (Currently implemented): Saving data after every command
  * Advantage: Data does not get lost if program suddenly exits. Changes are saved after every command.
  * Disadvantage: Slows the program down when there is large amount of data to be saved.
* Option 2: Save data once upon exit
  * Advantage: More efficient and better performance of the program.
  * Disadvantage: If program crashes, no data is saved.

### Parser Component
API: `CommandParser.java`

The [`CommandParser`](../src/main/java/fittrack/parser/CommandParser.java) is responsible for interpreting user inputs and converting it into executable commands.
It plays the role of connecting the user interface and the command execution components.

Refer to the core structure diagram in [Core Sequence](#core-sequence).

**Design Considerations**
* Had to make general methods for all commands.
  * CommandParser.parseCommand()
  * CommandParser.getBlankCommand()
  * Command.setArguments()
  * Command.execute()
* Method for parsing the data is written in each data classes.
  * Height.parseHeight()
  * Meal.parseMeal()
  * ...
* But not all methods.
  * CommandParser.parseIndex()
  * CommandParser.parseKeyword()
* Exception handling is crucial.
  * Users can type literally **anything** in CLI, so all possibilities must be checked.


### Command Component
API: `Command.java`

The command component is responsible for executing specific commands and return a command result.

{sequence or class diagram}

**Design Considerations**
* Write considerations here

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("deletemeal 1") call.

## Main Data Structures

---
### Implementation

**User Profile**

The user profile class basic deals with all profile settings and data. Storing, organising and calculating data related 
to the user's personal data is done in this class. All first time users are required to enter their height, weight, max 
daily calorie intake and gender before they can begin. For the categorisation of BMI, a hashmap is used.

**MealList**

The meal list class is used to keep track of meals and calories consumed by the user. It uses an arraylist to store the 
meals that the user has eaten, including the calories and the date.

**WorkoutList**

Similar to the meal list class, the workoutlist class is used to keep track of all workouts done by the user. It also uses an
arraylist to store the workouts, including the calories burnt and the date of the workout.

**StepList**

The steplist keeps track of the steps the user has made and store it in an arraylist. The user
inputs the number of steps as well as the date.

---
## Commmands

---
### 1. Add Function
The add function has three commands - `addmeal`, `addworkout` and `addsteps`. The three commands allows
the user to add their meals, workouts and number of steps respectively.

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**

Here is an example of `addmeal` command which has 2 compulsory arguments `name` and `c/` and one optional argument `d/`.

Example:
```
addmeal chicken c/200 d/2023-11-11
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of addmeal/workout/steps.

*Step 1:*

The `addmeal` command instance calls the commandParser where the arguments are split - name, calories and date.

*Step 2:*

The name of the meal, calories and date will be added to the mealList.

*Step 3:*

The added meal is then displayed to the user through the Ui


The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the `addmeal` mechanism:
![AddMeal Sequence Diagram](images/AddMealSequenceDiagram.svg)

### 2. Delete Function
The delete function has three commands - `deletemeal`, `deleteworkout` and `deletesteps`. The three commands allows
the user to delete their meals, workouts and number of steps respectively.

**Design Considerations**

When choosing an item to delete, the team decided to let the user delete based on the index of the workout/meal based on the workoutList/mealList.
This is because it is likely the user has been referring to the mealList/workoutList before deciding to delete an item off it.
Furthermore, the using of index (numbers) will be much easier to input for the users than the full name of the meal/workout.

**Implementation**

Here is an example of `deletemeal` command which has 1 compulsory argument `index`.

Example:
```
deletemeal 1
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of deletemeal/workout/steps.

*Step 1:*

The `deletemeal` command instance calls DeleteMealCommand class.

Example:
```
Meal toDelete = mealList.getMeal(mealIndex);
mealList.deleteMeal(mealIndex);
return new CommandResult("I've deleted the following meal:" + "\n" + toDelete.toString());
```
*Step 2:*

The code above is a snippet of how a meal is deleted.

*Step 3:*

The deleted meal is then displayed to the user through the Ui


The sequence diagram for `deletemeal` mechanism is shown [here](#command-component):


### 3. Find Function
The find function has two commands - `findmeal` and `findworkout`. The two commands allows
the user to view their meals, workouts, number of steps and user profile respectively.

**Design Considerations**
- Search Criteria: The function must allow the user to specify each keyword to filter items they are looking for.
- Speed: To optimise and enhance the user experience, the search speed should be quick and responsive to reduce wait time of receiving search results.

**Implementation**

Here is an example of `findmeal` command which has 1 compulsory argument `keyword`. The keyword is the word
the user wishes to search for.

Example of usage:
```
findmeal chicken
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of findmeal/workout.

*Step 1:*

The `findmeal` command instance calls FindMealCommand class where the keyword is parsed into setArguments to check its validity.

Example:
```
for (Meal meal : meals) {
    if (meal.getName().contains(keyword)) {
        if (!mealFound) {
            mealFound = true;
            String foundMessage = "These meals contain the keyword " + keyword + ":";
            feedbackBuilder.append(foundMessage).append("\n");
        }
        String mealWithNumber = (mealNum + 1) + "." + meal;
        feedbackBuilder.append(mealWithNumber).append("\n");
        numFound++;
    }
    mealNum++;
}
if (!mealFound) {
    return new CommandResult("Sorry, there are no such meals found.");
}
```

*Step 2:*

The code above shows the algorithm to search for the keyword. This is executed in the `execute()` function and the command result is returned.

*Step 3:*

The list of meals with the keyword will be shown to the user through the Ui.

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the `findmeal` mechanism:
![Find Function Sequence Diagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.svg)

### 4. Calories Function
The calories function has three commands - `caloriesconsumed`, `caloriesBurnt` and `caloriebalance`. The commands allow the user to monitor the amount of calories they consumed/burnt from meals/workouts
on a specified date. `caloriebalance` also allows them to monitor their net calorie gain daily 
compared to their daily calorie limit that they set in their profile.

**Design Considerations**

The team have decided to come out with all three different features so the user can monitor these data separately.
The data are then collated based on dates so that the users can monitor their intakes based on specific days,
which aligns well with the daily calorie intake they have set for themselves.

The creation of such features also will help in the convenience for the users as they do not have to manually
count from the mealList/workoutList. Furthermore, caloriebalance will also aid users who are aiming for
calorie deficit/surplus!

**Implementation**

Here is an example of `caloriebalance` command which has 1 compulsory argument date. The date is the specific date
that the user wants to see his calorie balance for.

Example of usage:
```
caloriebalance 2023-11-13
```

*Step 1:*
The commandParser will make sure that the date inputted is in the correct format.

*Step 2:*
The program will then retrieve the daily calorie limit set by the user.

*Step 3:*
The current mealList is iterated through and subtract the daily calorie limit with whatever meals that are consumed
on the specific date. The same will be done for workoutList.

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the `caloriebalance` mechanism:
![CalorieBalance Sequence Diagram](images/CalorieBalanceSequenceDiagram.svg)


### 5. Help Function
Help command outputs general help message if there's no argument,
and outputs the help of the given command if certain command is given as an argument.

For example, `help` outputs general help message, and `help addmeal` outputs
help message for `addmeal` command.

**Design Considerations**

The design has to differentiate between the cases which has no argument and has an argument
looking for help. Also, when developer adds more commands, it's better to work less.
So I wanted the help function to behave well if a developer writes only a description and
a usage of the command.

**Implementation**

*Step 1:*
From the given argument, get the first word of the argument, which is the command word.
If the argument is an empty string, set help message with a general help message.

*Step 2:*
Get the blank command instance based on the command word.

*Step 3:*
Get the help message from the blank command instance. It uses getHelp() method. If you want to
add new command, then you have to implement getHelp() method for the help function.

*Step 4:*
The result of command execution is the help message in step 3.

The diagram below shows part of the class/sequence structure of the {help} mechanism:
![Help Function](images/HelpCommand.svg)

### 6. Step Function
The step functionality has a suite of commands namely `addsteps`, `deletesteps`, `viewsteps`, `totalsteps`
and `getstepssuggestions`. 

The commands allow the user to add, delete, view, get total steps and get suggestions (based on the calories
they walk and their daily calorie goal) respectively.

**Design Considerations**
- The input of steps must be use-friendly and easy for user to input the number of steps. This would enhance user experience.
- The presentation of steps has to be clear and fast.

**Implementation**

Here is an example of the step command. For `addsteps` and `viewsteps`, the command has 2 compulsory arguments `steps` and `date`.
If a date is not provided, it will default to the current date.

```
addsteps 2000 d/2023-10-23
totalsteps 2023-10-23
viewsteps
deletesteps 1
getstepssuggestions 2023-10-23
```
As all of these are commands that perform a specific task, they inherit the Command class (like all other commands).
The steps command will specifically interact with the `stepList` in the superclass

- `addsteps` will add a new `Step` object to the `stepList`.
- `totalsteps` will iterate through the list and sum up all the steps taken on the specified date.
- `viewsteps` will iterate through the stepList and display all the steps taken in a list form.
- `deletesteps` will remove a specified step from the `stepList` based on its index.
- `getstepssuggestions` will calculate the calories burnt based on the steps taken and the user's weight. It 
will then suggest how many more steps they need to take to meet their daily calorie goal.

The below sequence diagram shows the sequence of the `addsteps` command: 
![Sequence of adding steps](images/AddStepCommand-0.png)

...and `deletesteps` command.
![Sequence of deleting steps](images/DeleteStepsCommand-0.png)

### 7. Handling an Invalid Input
If user enters invalid input, the app uses `InvalidCommand` class to handle it.

**Design Considerations**

Designed to provide an information why the user input is invalid.
Also, help of command is provided if the input command is known.

**Implementation**

*Step 1:*
If input command fails matching, command word is invalid, or any of command arguments is invalid,
CommandParser.getInvalidCommand() method is called.

*Step 2:*
Create `HelpCommand` instance to get a help message for the invalid input.

*Step 3:*
Use `HelpCommand`'s execution result and exception message to make a feedback to user.

Refer to [`CommandParser`](../src/main/java/fittrack/parser/CommandParser.java), [`InvalidCommand`](../src/main/java/fittrack/command/InvalidCommand.java),[`HelpCommand`](../src/main/java/fittrack/command/HelpCommand.java) classes for more information.

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {help} mechanism:
