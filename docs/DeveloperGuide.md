Hello! What would you like to do?
____________________________________________________________

```

You are now ready to begin developing! If you would like to exit Syslib, type `exit` to exit the program.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Design & Implementation
## Architecture Overview | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" />

The above diagram is a simplified overview of Syslib and its components. More details can be found in the following sections.  

**Main components of SysLib Architecture**

SysLib currently consists of five main components:

- `Syslib`: Initializes other components and acts as the "launching pad" by executing important methods
- `UI`: Handles User Interaction such as getting user input
- `Parser`: Parsing User Input  
- `Command`: Command Executor 
- `Storage`: Loads data from file in hard disk, and saves data to hard disk on program exit

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The following diagram shows an overview of how components in Syslib work and interact with each other. 

<img src="images/ComponentDiagram.png" />

1. After all components have been initialized, `Syslib` calls upon the `Storage` component to load any data from `storage.txt`.
2. `Storage` fills two lists, ResourcesList and EventsList, with the read data. Both lists are returned to Syslib.
3. Syslib creates a GenericList containing of these filled lists. 
4. Afterwhich, `UI` is called to get and return user input.
5. Syslib passes the returned user input to `Parser` for processing.
6. `Parser` calls the appropriate command based on the user input, for example `AddCommand`.
7. `Command` carries out necessary actions and returns a `CommandResult` object which holds the message to be displayed to user. `Parser` prints the feedback to user.
8. Once the user input has been processed and executed, Syslib calls `Storage` to save the current state of the lists to `storage.txt`.
9. `Storage` retrieves the lists in `Parser` and writes to `storage.txt`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Component Overview | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

### UI Component

`UI` component consists of a single `UI` Class.
which manages interaction (prompting for user input and displaying results
of commands/methods being called) between the user and the application.

How the UI class works:
* Upon the initialization of `SysLib`, the `UI` class will call the `showWelcomeMessage` method to display the greeting messages to
  the user.
* Additionally, local files storing the data of previously saved work of `SysLib` will also be loaded into the program through the initialization of the `Storage` Class. Thereafter,
  the loading statuses of these files are also displayed by calling the `showLoadMessage()` method.
    * If `storage.txt` does not exist, it will also call the `showNoFileFoundMessage()` to let the user know a new `storage.txt` file will be created.
    * However, if `storage.txt` already exists, `showFileFoundMessage()` will be called instead.
* `UI` class is also responsible for getting the user input by calling the `readCommand()`
  method, which will then parse the input by sending it to the `Parser` class. The `Parser` class will process 
  the input and make use of the `Command` class to execute the command.
* UI also prints Resource details in a formatted table using the `showResourcesDetails` method.
* Help messages are also printed in the `UI` class by calling `showHelpMessage()` method.
* Lastly, when the user exits the program, the `showExitMessage()` method will be called to indicate that the
  user has successfully exited the program.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Parser Component

The parsing for a generic command can be seen here:

<img src="images/Parsing.png" />

For some commands that does not require arguments (etc: `help`, `exit`), `parseArgument()`
and `validateStatement()` will not be called

If an invalid command is given, the nearest command will be searched for via the `suggest` function in `suggestParser`.
If the nearest command is similar to what the user typed, it will be suggested

For more details on each Command, check them out [below](#implementation--return-to-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Command Component
The `Command` component is linked to the `Parser` component. 
After the `Parser` filters out the correct command, that particular command will be executed.

Each `Command` uses a `GenericList` to get Events or Resources to manipulate. 
Then the commands will generate a `CommandResult` to give informative feedback to the user.

<img src="images/CommandClassDiagram.png" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage Component

This component of Syslib is mainly responsible for reading and writing application data from and to files stored on the user’s filesystem. This is to allow the user to retain the data he/she has entered into Syslib and be able to continue using the data when he/she starts Syslib the next time.

The following class diagram shows how the storage component’s classes and how it interacts with some other components and classes in Syslib:

<img src="images/StorageDiagram.png" height="350"/>

On the user’s local filesystem, the organisation of the application files are as follows:

```
 data/        // Primary folder for storage
 └── storage.txt                    // Text file containing a list of resources and events saved.
 logs/        // Folder for logs of each command
 ├── findCommandLogs.log            // Log file containing logs created by the Find Command
 ├── addCommandLogs.log             // Log file containing logs created by the Add Command
 ├── eventCommandLogs.log           // Log file containing logs created by the Event Commands
 ├── helpCommandLogs.log            // Log file containing logs created by the Help Command
 ├── listCommandLogs.log            // Log file containing logs created by the List Command
 ├── Storage.log                    // Log file containing logs created by the Storage uses
 └── summaryCommandLogs.log         // Log file containing logs created by the Summary Command
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Implementation | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)
This section provides details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Resource Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

The `add` feature is responsible for processing user commands to add a new resource to SysLib. It is facilitated by 
the `AddCommand` component. It works with `Parser` and `Command` components to parse and validate the user input. 
The new resource is stored internally in `resourcesList` as a `Book`, `EBook`, `CD`, `Magazine`, `EMagazine`, `Newspaper`, 
or `ENewspaper` depending on the type of resources specified by `tag`. 

There are seven types of `Resource`:
- Book
- EBook
- CD
- Magazine
- EMagazine
- Newspaper
- ENewspaper

`add` has eighteen possible options:  

- **Book** has four options:
  - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] `
  - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /g [genre]`
  - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /s [status]`
  - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /g [genre] /s [status]`
- **EBook** has four options:
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /l [link]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /l [link] /g [genre]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /l [link] /s [status]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /a [author] /tag [tag] /l [link] /g [genre] /s [status]`
- **CD** has two options:
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /c [creator] /ty [type] /tag [tag]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /c [creator] /ty [type] /tag [tag] /s [status]`
- **Magazine** has two options:
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /b [brand] /is [issue] /tag [tag]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /b [brand] /is [issue] /tag [tag] /s [status]`
- **EMagazine** has two options:
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /b [brand] /is [issue] /tag [tag] /l [link]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /b [brand] /is [issue] /tag [tag] /l [link] /s [status]`
- **Newspaper** has two options:
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /p [publisher] /ed [edition] /tag [tag]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /p [publisher] /ed [edition] /tag [tag] /s [status]`
- **ENewspaper** has two options:
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /p [publisher] /ed [edition] /tag [tag] /l [link]`
    - `add /i [isbn] /t [title] /p [publisher] /ed [edition] /tag [tag] /l [link] /s [status]`
  
#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:

- `AddCommand#execute(statement: String, container: GenericList<Resource, Event>)` -- Validates and adds the new resource into the resource list.
- `Parser#parseAddCommand(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to extract the tag indicating the type of resource.
- `Parser#checkFirstItem(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to ensure that the first item in the input command is valid.
- `AddCommand#addResource*(statement: String, container: GenericList<Resource, Event>)` -- Adds a new resource to the resource list after validation.
- `ParseResource*#parseAddResource*(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to ensure that it follows the right format for the particular resource.
- `ParseResource*#parseResource*Args(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to ensure that all attributes required by the particular resource are parsed.
- `ParseResource#hasUnusedSlash(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to ensure that there are no extra slashes.
- `ParseResource*#hasInvalidArgument(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to ensure that there are no invalid arguments.
- `ParseAttribute#parseAttribute*(statement: String)`-- Parses the input command to ensure that each attribute follows the right format.
- `ParseResource#countDuplicate(statement: String, pattern: String)` -- Counts the number of matches found for the same argument. 
- `ParseResource*#checkEmptyResource*Args(args: String[])` -- Parses the attribute to ensure that all attributes are not empty.
- `ParseResource*#checkEmptyArg(args: String[])` -- Parses the arguments to ensure that every argument is valid.
- `CreateResource#createResource*(values: String[], resourceID: int)` -- Creates a new resource with the given information.
- `ParseResource*#resetResource*Args()` - Clears the previous attributes to receive new attributes for new resource.

#### Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between objects for the add feature:

<img src="images/AddSequenceDiagram.png"/>

It shows the interaction between seven main classes
- Parser
  - Parser
  - ParseResource* (ParseBook / ParseEBook / ParseCD / ParseMagazine / ParseEMagazine / ParseNewspaper / ParseENewspaper)
  - ParseResource
  - ParseAttribute
- Command 
  - CommandResult
  - AddCommand
- CreateResource

#### Example Usage Scenario

Step 1. The user inputs the command: `add /i 9783161484100 /t Crime and Punishment /a Dostoevsky /tag B /g Fiction /s lost`.

Step 2. The `Parser` processes the command and calls `AddCommand#execute(statement: String, container: GenericList<Resource, Event>)` 
with `/i 9783161484100 /t Crime and Punishment /a Dostoevsky /tag B /g Fiction /s lost`.

Step 3. `AddCommand` receives the command and calls `Parser#parseAddCommand(statement: String)` to extract the tag.

Step 4. The first thing `Parser` does is to call `Parser#checkFirstItem(statement: String)` to ensure that there are no 
unaccepted components in the input.

Step 5. Since the `tag` argument in the input command indicates that it is a book, the `AddCommand` calls
`AddCommand#addBook(statement: String, container: GenericList<Resource, Event>)`.

Step 6. Before adding the book, validation needs to be done so `ParseBook#parseAddBook(statement: String)` was called 
to ensure that the overall input is in the correct format and the required data is provided.

Step 7. After `ParseBook` receives the command, it calls `ParseBook#parseBookArgs(statement: String)` to start
the process of parsing every attribute of the resource.

Step 8. `ParseBook` performs the following operations to validate the overall input:
- Calls `ParseResource#hasUnusedSlash(statement: String)` to ensure that there are no slashes that should not appear.
- Calls `ParseResource*#hasInvalidArgument(statement: String)` to ensure that all arguments given are valid.

Step 9. `ParseBook` performs the following operations to validate each data in the input:
- Calls `ParseAttribute#parseIsbn(statement: String)` to validate and extract ISBN.
- Calls `ParseAttribute#parseTitle(statement: String)` to validate and extract title.
- Calls `ParseAttribute#parseAuthor(statement: String)` to validate and extract author.
- Calls `ParseAttribute#parseTag(statement: String)` to validate and extract tag.
- Calls `ParseAttribute#parseGenre(statement: String)` to validate and extract genres.
- Calls `ParseAttribute#parseStatus(statement: String)` to validate and extract status.
The above calls will each call `ParseResource#countDuplicate(statement: String, pattern: String)` to ensure that the 
same argument does not appear more than once. These extracted attributes form `args: String[]`.

Step 10. After `ParseBook` checked if optional attributes were provided by the user, it checks whether there were empty 
attributes by calling `ParseResource*#checkEmptyResource*Args(args: String[])`. `ParseResource*#checkEmptyArg(args: String[])`
will then be called to check if every argument is valid. After that, all the data are forwarded to `AddCommand`.

Step 11. `AddCommand` receives the arguments and calls `CreateResource#createBook(values: String[], resourceID: int` to 
craft a new book with the validated data.

Step 12. The newly created book is then added to the `resourcesList`.

Step 13. Calls to `ParserResource#resetBookArgs()` prepares the arguments list for new processes.

Step 14. Feedback to users are then sent to `CommandResult` to be displayed to the users.

#### Activity Diagram
The following activity diagram shows an overview of how the activities flow when a user executes the add command:

<img src="images/AddActivityDiagram.png"/>

Step 1. First, it goes into `execute()` where all the functions for adding a resource occur.  
Step 2. An information is added to the log to record the start of execution.  
Step 3. Next, `parseAddCommand()` will identify the type of resource to add.
Step 4. If it is a book, it will call `addBook()` where validation and addition of book occurs. 
If it is none of the listed resources, the add function will stop.  
Step 5. `parseAddBook()` and `parseBookArgs()` will validate every part of the input.  
Step 6. If it manages to pass all the validation, it will proceed to the next step. Else, the add function will stop.  
Step 7. A resource is created by passing the parsed data to `createBook()`.  
Step 8. Finally, this newly created book will be added to the `resourceList`.  
Step 9. A message will be displayed to indicate the successful addition of resource.  
Step 10. Lastly, an information is added to the log to record the resource that has been added.

#### Note
- The word "Resource*" can be replaced by any of the resources 
  - For example, ParseResource* and CreateResource* can be interpreted as ParseBook and CreateBook for the process of adding a book
- The word "Attribute*" can be replaced by any of the attributes
  - For example, parseAttribute* can be interpreted as parseTag or parseIsbn or parseTitle, etc

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Show Resources Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

Show resources feature is facilitated by the `UI`  component. It makes use of a class `ResourceDisplayFormatter` in `UI` to show the details of all resources stored in `ResourcesList` of the `Parser` component, sorted by resource type. 

#### Implementation

Show Resources feature implements the following operations:
- `UI#showResourcesDetails(resourcesList: List<Resource>)` — Displays a table showing details of all resources sorted by resource type.
- `Resource#checkColumnsWidth(columnsWidth: List<Integer>)` — Checks the length of certain resource attributes against the width of columns and adjusts width if displaying the resource attribute would break the alignment
- `Resource#toTableFormat(formatString: String, tableFormatter: Formatter)` — Formats a string of aligned resource details 

Show Resources feature can be used when the user wants a list of resources and their details, such as when executing the `list` command or showing the results of `find` command. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the show resources feature works in a scenario where the ListCommand calls showResourcesDetails() method.

<img src="images/ShowResourcesSequenceDiagram.png" height="450"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**ResourceDisplayFormatter class:** 

1. A List< Resource > resourcesList is passed in to `showResourcesDetails` method from the calling function. It can be the resourcesList retrieved from the GenericList in memory which contains the data of all resources, or a custom resourcesList containing filtered resources.
2. A new `ResourceDisplayFormatter` is instantiated and the constructor calls `buildDisplayHeader()` to create a table header. 
3. `buildDisplayHeader()` then calls `checkColumnsWidth()` for every resource in `resourcesList`. It passes an integer array containing the current column width for each resource attribute (Title...Author..et cetera).
4. `checkColumnsWidth()` adjusts the width as needed depending on the length of the resource attributes and returns to Formatter
5. A format specifier is created with the columns' width. Example: `"%-5s %-20s ..."`
6. Formatter objects are created for each resource type: Book, Newspapers, Magazine, CDs. 

**UI Class:** 
7. Now the UI loops through the resourcesList and calls `setDisplayFormatter(Resource)` to add the formatted string to its respective display formatter. 
8. A final call to `getFinalDisplayFormat()` returns the final formatted message of the table and all the resource details as `messageToDisplay`
9. `messageToDisplay` is returned to the calling function to be printed to user or for testing. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Resource Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

The `find` command allows users to search for resources based on specified filters such as author (`/a`), ISBN (`/i`), ID (`/id`), and title (`/t`). The results will show all resources that match any of the given filters.

> For non-book resources, `author` refers to `publisher`,`creator` and `brand` for Newspapers, CD's and Magazines
> respectively.

`find` has the following options:
- `find /id [ID]`
- `find /t [TITLE]`
- `find /a [AUTHOR/PUBLISHER/BRAND/CREATOR]`
- `find /i [ISBN]`

Multiple filters can also be combined:

- `find /t [TITLE] /a [AUTHOR/PUBLISHER/BRAND/CREATOR]`

#### Implementation

Upon receiving the `find` command, the system will:

1. Parse the filters and their associated values.
2. Filter the resources based on the given filters.
3. Display the matching resources.

#### Example Usage Scenario

**Step 1.** The user inputs the command: `find /a "F. Scott Fitzgerald"`

**Step 2.** The `UI` component forwards the input to `SYSLIB`, which then sends it to the `PARSER`.

**Step 3.** The `PARSER` processes the command, extracts the `author` filter, and retrieves all resources written by "F. Scott Fitzgerald".

**Step 4.** The matching resources are displayed to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Examples for Testing

1. **Find by Author**
    - Test case: `find /a "F. Scott Fitzgerald"`

      Expected: All resources written by F. Scott Fitzgerald are displayed.

2. **Find by ISBN**
    - Test case: `find /i "9780061120084"`

      Expected: The resource with ISBN "9780061120084" is displayed, which should be "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee.

3. **Find by ID**
    - Test case: `find /id 2`

      Expected: The resource with ID "2" is displayed, which should be "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee.

4. **Find by Title**
    - Test case: `find /t "The Great Gatsby"`

      Expected: The resource titled "The Great Gatsby" is displayed.

5. **Combining Filters**
    - Test case: `find /a "F. Scott Fitzgerald" /t "The Great Gatsby"`

      Expected: Resources that match both the title "The Great Gatsby" and the author "F. Scott Fitzgerald" are displayed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing Resources Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

The `list` command is facilitated by `Parser` and `UI` component to show the details of all resources in `resourcesList`. Furthermore, **filter** options can be provided to only list specific resources that match the given filters. 

`list` has five possible options:
- `list`
- `list /tag [tag]`
- `list /g [genre]`
- `list /s [status]`
- `list /tag [tag] /g [genre] /s [status]`

Arguments in italics are filter options and are **optional**. 


#### Implementation 

ListCommand implements the following operations:
- `ListCommmand#execute(statement: String, container: GenericList<Resource, Event>)` — Executes and carries out list feature operations
- `ListCommand#filterResources(givenParameters: String[], resourcesList: List<Resource>>)` — Filters resources based on given filter values


Given below is an example usage scenario where a user enters the input `list /tag B` to list all Resources with tag `B` 
and the corresponding sequence diagram. 

<img src="images/ListSequenceDiagram.png" />

When a user enters `list /tag B`, the Parser retrieves the parameters from the input and
calls the `execute` function of ListCommand, passing the argument given: `/tag B`.

ListCommand then calls `parseArg` and `validate` from `Command`, which checks if the parameters are valid. If it passes
   the checks, `filterResources` is called to begin the filtering process. First it calls `hasFilters()` to check if the user
   selected any filters `[tag/genre/status]` or none. 

If hasFilters returns `true`, it filters the `resourcesList` with the given keywords. Resources matching the filters are added to a temporary list called `matchedResources`. After all resources has been checked, `matchedResources` list is passed to `showResourcesDetails()`, a method called from `UI` to display the details 
of the resources. 

If hasFilters returns `false`, it skips the filtering process and displays the details of all the resources.

Finally, `ListCommand` instantiates the `CommandResult` class with a string `feedbackToUser`, which is returned to the `Parser` which will `print(commandResult.feedbackToUser)` to show the resource details.

### Edit Command Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

The `edit` command is facilitated by `Parser` component to update the attributes of any resource type. Users can edit all attributes except ID, Tag, and Received Date, and must provide at least one argument to edit when calling the `edit` command. 


#### Implementation

EditCommand implements the following operations:
- `EditCommand#execute(statement: String, container: GenericList<Resource, Event>)` — Executes and handles editing of a resource
- `EditCommand#editResources(foundResource: Resource, givenParameters: String[], resourcesList: List<Resource>)` — Validates parameters and updates a resource details

#### Usage Scenario 

EditCommand may be used when the user would like to update a resource [Book/Newspaper/CDs/Magazines/...] et cetera. Below is an activity diagram showing the flow of SysLib when a user enters `"edit /id 1 /t NEWTITLE /a NEWAUTHOR"`. The diagram starts off with EditCommand's `execute()` method.

<img src="images/EditActivityDiagram.png" />

First, `EditCommand` checks if the user has given at least one argument to edit. For example, `/t` or `/a`. If true, it searches for the resource that has the ID matching the ID given by the user. In this case, it searches for `id == 1`. 

Once found, it moves on to the `editResouce()` method, which contains a switch case that further calls the appropriate edit function based on the resource type. For example, if the resource is a Book or EBook, `validateBookParameters()` and `editBook()` is called. Else, it checks if it's a `CD` and so on. 

The edit methods updates the resource with all the details the user has provided. In this case, `title` is updated to `NEWTITLE` and `author` is updated to `NEWAUTHOR`.

Finally, the resource list currently in memory is updated with the new resource details by calling `resourcesList.set(resourceIndex, updatedResource)`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Event Add Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

The `eventadd` feature is responsible for processing user commands to add an `Event` to SysLib. It is facilitated by
the `EventAddCommand` component. It works with `Parser` and `Command` components to parse and validate the user input.
The new book is stored internally in `eventList` as a `Event`.

`eventadd` has two options:
- `eventadd /t [title] /date [date]`
- `eventadd /t [title] /date [date] /desc [description]`

#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:

- `EVENTADDCOMMAND#parseArgument(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to extract relevant information.
- `EVENTADDCOMMAND#validate(statement: String, values: String[])` -- Validates the input statement to ensure that it is valid.
- `EVENTADDCOMMAND#binarySearch(container: GenericList<Resource, Event>, date: Date)` -- Search for the correct index of event list to add the event.

#### Example Usage Scenario

Step 1. The user inputs the command: `eventadd /t birthday /date 10 Dec 2001`

Step 2. The `UI` component forwards the input to `SYSLIB`, which in turn passes it to the `PARSER`.

Step 3. The `PARSER` processes the command and determines that it contains a valid key (`eventadd`). It then calls
`EVENTADDCOMMAND#execute(statement: String, this: Parser)` with the input command.

Step 4. The `EVENTADDCOMMMAND` component receives the command and performs the following operations:
- Calls `EVENTADDCOMMAND#parseArgument(statement: String)` to extract values for title, date and description.
- Calls `EVENTADDCOMMAND#validate(statement: String, values: String[])` to ensure the validity of the input command.

Step 5. The `COMMAND` component processes the input command to ensure that it meets the required format and constraints.
It prepares the argument values for further processing.

Step 6. The `EVENTADDCOMMMAND` also calls the component:
- Calls `EVENTADDCOMMAND#binarySearch(container: GenericList<Resource, Event>, date: Date)` to find the correct index based on the date.
The whole eventList is sorted by date order.

Step 7. The newly created event is forwarded to the `PARSER` to be added to the `eventList`.

#### Example Usage Scenario

Step 1. The user inputs the command: `eventlist`

Step 2. The `UI` component forwards the input to `SYSLIB`, which in turn passes it to the `PARSER`.

Step 3. The `PARSER` processes the command and determines that it contains a valid key (`eventlist`). It then calls
`EVENTLISTCOMMAND#execute(statement: String, this: Parser)` with the input command.

Step 4. The `EVENTLISTCOMMMAND` component receives the command and performs the following operations:
- Calls `EVENTLISTCOMMAND#isEmpty()` to check if the user input any additional redundant arguments.

Step 5. The `EVENTLISTCOMMAND` then outputs the events in the eventList.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Event Delete Feature | [Return to contents](#table-of-contents)

The `eventdelete` feature is responsible for processing user commands to delete an event to SysLib. 
It is facilitated by the `EventDeleteCommand` component. 
It works with `Parser` and `Command` components to parse and validate the input.
The `Event` is removed from `eventsList`.

`eventdelete` has one options:
- eventdelete /id [index]

#### Implementation

It implements the following operations:

- `EVENTDELETECOMMAND#parseArgument(statement: String)` -- Parses the input command to extract relevant information.
- `EVENTDELETECOMMAND#validate(statement: String, values: String[])` -- Validates the input statement.
- `EVENTDELETECOMMAND#parseCalendarInt(value: String, container: GenerticList)` -- Validate the index given.

#### Example Usage Scenario

Step 1. The user inputs the command: `eventdelete /id 0`

Step 2. The `UI` component forwards the input to `SYSLIB`, which in turn passes it to the `PARSER`.

Step 3. The `PARSER` processes the command and determines that it contains a valid key (`eventadd`). It then calls
`EVENTDELETECOMMAND#execute(statement: String, this: Parser)` with the input command.

Step 4. The `EVENTDELETECOMMAND` component receives the command and performs the following operations:
- Calls `EVENTDELETECOMMAND#parseArgument(statement: String)` to extract values for title, date and description.
- Calls `EVENTDELETECOMMAND#validate(statement: String, values: String[])` to ensure the validity of the input command.

Step 5. The `COMMAND` component processes the input command to ensure that it meets the required format and constraints.
It prepares the argument values for further processing.

Step 6. The `EVENTDELETECOMMAND` also calls the component:
- Calls `EVENTDELETECOMMAND#parseCalendarInt(value: String, container: GenerticList)` to see if the index is an integer and that
it is within range of eventsList

Step 7. The selected event at the index is then deleted from the eventsList.

- `EVENTEDITCOMMAND#binarySearch(container: GenericList<Resource, Event>t, date: Date)` -- Search for the correct index of event list to add the event.

#### Example Usage Scenario

Step 1. The user inputs the command: `eventedit /i 0 /date 23 Dec 2023`

Step 2. The `UI` component forwards the input to `SYSLIB`, which in turn passes it to the `PARSER`.

Step 3. The `PARSER` processes the command and determines that it contains a valid key (`evenedit`). It then calls
`EVENTEDITCOMMAND#execute(statement: String, container: GenerticList)` with the input command.

Step 4. The `EVENTEDITCOMMMAND` component receives the command and performs the following operations:
- Calls `EVENTEDITCOMMAND#parseArgument(statement: String)` to extract values for the attributes to edit.
- Calls `EVENTEDITCOMMAND#validate(statement: String, values: String[])` to ensure the validity of the input command.

Step 5. The `COMMAND` component processes the input command to ensure that it meets the required format and constraints.
It prepares the argument values for further processing.

Step 6. The `EVENTEDITCOMMMAND` also calls the component:
- Calls `EVENTEDITCOMMAND#binarySearch(container: GenericList<Resource, Event>, date: Date)` to find the correct index based on the date.
