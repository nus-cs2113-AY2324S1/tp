# Stocker

Stocker is a desktop app  that will provide quick access to currently available stock,
track incoming stock and expiration dates, and categorize drugs based on different labels.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, Stocker
can get your inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
