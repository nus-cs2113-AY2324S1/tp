## Introduction

Financial Planner is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing your finances conveniently. 
It is optimized for use via the CLI and leverages your expertise in CLI and your ability to type fast and gives 
you a one-stop interface to access a plethora of features to manage your finances.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `Financial Planner` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T18-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for Financial Planner.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run the application.
5. Refer to the **Features** section below for details of each command.

## Features

### Notes about the command format
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.

  e.g. in `add income /a AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT` is a parameter which can be used as `add income /a 100`.
- Items in square brackets are optional.

  e.g. `[/r DAYS]` can be used as `/r 30` or left empty.

### Notes about naming convention
- Cashflow refers to an income or expense.

### Notes about program limitations
- Maximum amount for each cashflow and total balance that the program can hold is 999,999,999,999.99
- Minimum amount for each cashflow and total balance that the program can hold is -999,999,999,999.99
- Total Balance, Income balance, and Expense balance are different entities where the latter two do not have the same limitations.
- Maximum value for recurrences and indexes is 2,147,483,647, the maximum number an `int` can hold.

**Important:** Data is automatically loaded on start up and saved when exited. You must exit the program using the `exit` command in order to save your data.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Copy the /data/ folder from the home folder to the other computer.

**Q**: Should I edit the watchlist.json file?

**A**: You should not edit the watchlist.json file unless you are very familiar with the format used.
If you would like to edit the watchlist.json file directly to manipulate your watchlist, please follow the instructions
above in the watchlist feature section. However, do note that there is risk of file corruption.

**Q**: How is the radar chart derived?

After which, amounts of all other categories are taken as a ratio of the maximum category. The ratios are then displayed
in the radar chart

**Q**: Why can't I add Singapore exchange stocks or other exchange stocks using the add stock command? 

**A**: Due to the restrictions of the free API provided, only US-exchange stocks are provided. Sorry for the
inconvenience caused

**Q**: Why is it saying that API limit is reached, not working or something like that when I use watchlist 
features? 🤬
