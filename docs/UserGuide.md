## FAQ


**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Move the txt file from the folder where the jar file located, 
to the folder where the jar file located in the new computer 

**Q**: What do I need to do when I see the `format incorrect from storage file` at the beginning of running the program

**A**: The system will automatically remove that line from the txt after you give the first command to the bot, 
if you don't want to remove that line, just terminate the program using control c right after you see the error,
and change the line in txt file to the correct format.
