### Store and Edit Question Pool Using The Question File

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Storage:
* The storage operation is done automatically without the need for user input
* Any operation that updates the question pool will invoke the storage operation

Editing:
* You may directly update the storage file instead of adding questions with commands
* You should edit the `questionlist.txt` file in the working directory of the `QuizHub.jar` file
* If the `questionlist.txt` is not already present, you should run the program once for initialization
* You can edit the file in the format as described below.

Format:
* File header: The first line of the file should not be changed, questions will
begin from the second line onwards, with each question taking one line
* Short Answer Question: `S | <done/undone> | <question> / <answer> | <module> | <difficulty> `
  * S - Format identifier for short answer
  * done/undone - Use done or undone as indication
  * question/answer - Question and answer
  * module - Module for the question
  * difficulty - EASY, NORMAL or HARD
* Multiple Choice Question: `M | <done/undone> | <question> / <ans1> / <ans 2> / <ans 3> / <ans 4> / <correct ans> | <module> | <difficulty>`
  * M - Format identifier for multiple choice question
  * done/undone - Use done or undone as indication
  * question/ans1/ans2/ans3/ans4 - Questions and choices
  * correct ans - Index of correct answer from 1 through 4
  * Module - Module for the question
  * Difficulty - EASY, NORMAL or HARD
* Using arbitrary values may prevent the question from being loaded normally,
  questions that cannot be loaded will be removed from the storage file.
  Please use the add question feature in the program if you are unsure.
* You may find a sample of the storage file in the next page

## FAQ

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Transfer the `questionlist.txt` generated to the same local directory as the .jar file of the program in another
computer. The .jar file should be in its own directory.

**Q**: Why does my `questionlist.txt` look slightly different from when I run `list`?

**A**: The `questionlist.txt` generated is not originally designed to be seen by 
the user. The different format is used in order to parse questions without error.

**Q**: What's the difference between shuffle and /random mode in `start`?

**A**: During user testing, it was found that users sometimes will 
revise by looking at all the questions with `list`, as such functionality to 
shuffle the questions permanently was added.
