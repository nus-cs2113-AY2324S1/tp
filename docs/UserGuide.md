# User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the FITNUS UserGuide! We're glad you're here and if you have any questions about how to operate the application, all the information will be here for you.

## Quick Start

Please follows the steps below to start your Fitnus journey.

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `FITNUS` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-F11-1/tp/releases).
3. Put the downloaded jar file into any directory you prefer. This directory should allow read and write of any files inside the directory.
4. Open the command terminal on your device. Run the jar file using command `java -jar ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_JAR_FILE`. **If it failed, please try steps 5 and 6.**
5. Make sure that you start the terminal from the same position/directory where the jar file is stored. Below is an example on Windows.

6. Run the FITNUS app using command  `java -jar JAR_FILE_NAME.jar` where `JAR_FILE_NAME` is the name of the jar file as stored on your local computer
   
      A simple example as below, with downloaded file name "Fitnus":

## Features 

### Notes about the input command format

- For each type command, a specific `COMMAND FORMAT` is required. Please go through the following guidelines to look for the details of each command.

- Both `CAPITAL LETTER` and `small letter` are acceptable. But consecutive white space between words will be eliminated automatically.
  
  e.g. `VIEWG`, `viewG`, `viewg` will be consider the same. This is to favour the typing habits of different users.

- In some cases, you may need to input a date information. FitNus app provides the following supported formats.
  
  1. Format: "yyyy/MM/dd" (e.g., "2023/08/22")
  2. Format: "dd/MM/yyyy" (e.g., "22/08/2023")
 
  Command example: `set 1000 on 22/08/2023` (For setting a new goal command)

  Please note that some **unexisting date with correct format** will be treated as last day of the month. If you find the input date is wrong, please use a delete command to help you. (e.g. 31/02/2021 will be treated as 28/02/2021, depends on the year.)

## FAQs

**Q1**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: It is not suggested to transfer data between machines. The purpose of the app is developed solely for personal use. Nonetheless, you can copy the folder named `data` that is created in the same directory (location) as where you are running the application into your new computer to restore your data.

**Q2**: Can I edit the data inside my list? e.g. change the calories consumption targets in the goal list

**A**: Sorry but we do not support the function to edit a list directly. But you can remove a unwanted data from a list and insert a new data again.

**Q3**: I have accidentally mark an unaccomplished goal as achieved. Could I change the achievement?

**A**: Sorry but we do not allow user to modify achievement list. If you really want to destory a false record, you must remove all the achievements and start a new save file. One way of doing this is to delete the file "achievement.txt" under the folder "data" inside your jar file repository.

## Future Development

- We will update the achievement functionality such that we will have an algorithm to check whether you have achieved a particular goal by taking your exercise record and/or meal record into account. You don't need to worry about making false achievement.
- The goal list record will be updated at the start of the application to check if some current goals are not finished. It will mark such unfinished goal as failed automatically. User will also be allowed to delete such records by command.
- New feature to evaluate and seperate level of achievement
- New feature to differentiate proper level of goal for different people in different demand
